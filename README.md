# Roman's homebrew-schm1tz1 Tap 

This is my own Tap — a source for the [Brew](https://brew.sh) macOS package manager.


## Available Casks ##

* [sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) in the latest v1 Version (1.27.1) for backwards compatibility (e.g. compiling wireshark) - to avoid conflicts use the full cask name 'schm1tz1/schm1tz1/sparkle'
